Command Line Test System



Overview
This project is a Command Line Test System implemented in Bash on Linux. It allows users to sign up, sign in, take tests from a provided question bank, and view their previous test attempts. It logs all activities, including sign-ins, test-taking, and results in a log file with timestamps. The test system also supports user input timeouts, question timers, and stores answers in a CSV file.
